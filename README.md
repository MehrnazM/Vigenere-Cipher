# Vigenere-Cipher

This project is part of the "Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization", offered by Duke University on Coursera. It is an implementation of the Vigenere Cipher algorithm to encrypt a text file. It also contains the breaking method, which breaks the encryption method without knowing the key size and the langugae of the encrypted text. The edu library (implemented by the instructors of this specialization) that is used in this project is included.
